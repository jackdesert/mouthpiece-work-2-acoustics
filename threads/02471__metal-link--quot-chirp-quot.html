            <pre class='message__body'>This html message parsed with html2text ---------------------------I have a metal Otto Link "Super Tone Master" (mid 80s) tenor mouthpiece. It is
marked as a 6 (next to the table, not on the shank), but the tip opening
measured .085. It has a prominent metallic "chirp" to the sound which easily
turns into a super-high squeak (especially above the A above the staff).  
  
I flattened the table (which was very low in the middle), opened the tip to a
.100 (about the minimum needed to get a radial curve), lengthened the facing
to 46 (23mm), got the curve very, very close to my target measurements,
brought the now-too-high baffle down, straightened the side rails where they
had broadened near the tip, got a nice even-looking tip rail.  
  
While it plays much easier now, that chirp is still as strong as ever. It has
remained through every stage of play-testing so far. Another tenor player
loaned me a 70s metal Link (marked 4, but measuring .078) which has the same
problem.  
  
I appeal to the collective experience of the group here - any insights? Thanks
in advance.

an old brown- box Rico #5 (which had been sanded down to about a 4). All of
these reeds played OK (some play very well) on other mouthpieces. It was a
little better with the Superials and with the heavier Rico. I'll keep trying
different reeds.

            <pre class='message__body'>Here is a reply I previously composed on squeeking/chirping:

I have thought quite a bit on the physics of chirping.  The driving force
is high pressure.  Players almost never chirp at low sound volumes.  If a
piece is uneven or the facing curve has irregularities, it will not be
responsive and a player needs to use more pressure to make it speak.  With
high pressure often comes a tighter embouchure that closes off the tip
opening some.  This geometry is prone to squeaking� especially if the tip
is uneven and/or the baffle is high near the tip.  It allows the very tip
of the reed to vibrate like a mini reed at high frequency.  The high baffle
focuses the air even more.

The mouthpiece material has no effect on squeaks in my opinion.  However,
metal mouthpieces usually have higher baffles than non-metal mouthpieces. 
So it is common to think that metal is louder and squeaky.  But this is not
due to the material.

Players who like to play on the very tip of a mouthpiece are more prone to
chirps.  Players who take more mouthpiece in have less chirps.  When you
take in less mouthpiece, you usually close off some of the tip opening with
your embouchure.  A tight embouchure can do the same thing.  Often you
choose a harder reed to make this embouchure work for you.  Or you start
with too hard of a reed and forces your embouchure to be tight or towards
the tip.  This is not necessarily a bad embouchure.  Just be aware of the
factors at play here.

Reeds that have a thin tip and a thick heart are more prone to squeaks,
especially when used with long mouthpiece facings.  A Fibracell reed has a
cut that is difficult to make squeak.    When I use a Fibracell and take in
a little more mouthpiece, no mouthpiece squeaks for me.  However, some
players do not want to use Fibracells or change their embouchure.  Then,
working on the facing curve, tip rail and lowering the baffle some usually
helps.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks, Keith. I&#39;m thinking the baffle still has to be reduced some 
more. It&#39;s still pretty high, and a little long (compared to other tenor 
mouthpieces I like) - I&#39;m just being cautious when removing material. 
BTW, the table on this piece is significantly shorter than the reed. I 
have no idea if this would make any difference, but I&#39;ll try trimming a 
couple of reeds at the heel as an experiment.

            <pre class='message__body'>Check also for tiny leaks.  Examine the octave pads, make sure they are 
closing well.  Palm keys, etc.

I had a guy send me an RIA metal bari piece, same complaint.  He sent 
some of his reeds.  I put them on my bari, and I was squeeking, too.  My 
wife called from the other room, Paul, I have never heard you do that, 
what&#39;s the matter?

I tried some of my reeds, in this case, Fibracell, and the mouthpiece 
played great.  In fact, I sent it back untouched, and enclosed some 
Fibracells.  Well, the guy was thrilled.

            <pre class='message__body'>Metal 6 triggered my old chirping problem of some 20 years ago.  I just now
went down to my basement and check out the old link in my stash draw.  Yup a
Link 6*.  Seems like I remember  the chirps mainly occurred in around the
upper G sharp and A.   I knew another guy that had similar problems and they 
were blowing  a
Link also.

I suppose it could have been my embouchure but I got a Berg and the problem
was gone. I think the Berg is more open and I had to use a softer reed. 
Thus, things have changed so I couldn&#39;t compare.
 As I remember, back in the
80&#39;s(probably even earlier) metal Links were "in".  I&#39;m not bashing Links 
but just replying to the post with my
experience.

BTW, I enjoy this group as a "wannabe" mouthpiece repairman.  Also I think 
Keith&#39;s analysis of chriping covers it.  If I knew  what I know, now, 
perhaps I could have made changes to make the Link work for me.

I have a piece that was originally a Sugal SG II, which I have refacet and lowered the baffle so that it is midway between an SG I and SGII. Tip opening 102 after has leveled the table, facing length 46 Perfect for me with Vandoren V16 # 3 reeds.
My a problem is: When I play A2 (loud) and open (or just barely touches) palm key Eb then it squeaks very loud. I have sanded down the area behind the tip rail, lowered the baffle, adjusted the table and facing curve several times.

            <pre class='message__body'>Thanks for the advice! I would like to follow this advice, but I must admit that English is not my language, so I did not understand everything you wrote, especially this: "mill out the slanted baffle drop-off, turning it into a scoop-billed Berg" design." 

Isn&#39;t scoop-billed Berg a high baffle mouthpiece with a sharp edge where the baffle ends? I&#39;ve already rounded the baffle where it enters the chamber. Should I round it more or should I make it sharper? Or is it the chamber that have to be bigger? I did not think that the baffle so far inside the mpc would create a squeak, I thought this was due to the baffle closer to the tip.

      Thanks for the advice! I would like to follow this advice, but I must admit that English is not my language, so I did not understand everything you wrote, especially this: "mill out the slanted baffle drop-off, turning it into a scoop-billed Berg" design." 



Isn&#39;t scoop-billed Berg a high baffle mouthpiece with a sharp edge where the baffle ends? I&#39;ve already rounded the baffle where it enters the chamber. Should I round it more or should I make it sharper? Or is it the chamber that have to be bigger? I did not think that the baffle so far inside the mpc would create a squeak, I thought this was due to the baffle closer to the tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>FWIW my experience has been that chirps are caused, or at least made more probable, by a very high baffle just behind the tip rail. But is is not easy to change that on a metal mpc. You can use diamond half-round or round files, but slowly and carefully. 

You much check your side rails for evenness. If they are uneven that can definitely cause chirping. I&#39;ve not found adjustment further back toward the chamber of any use in relation to chirps.

            <pre class='message__body'>Volume-frequency mismatch notwithstanding, I do not see how this would tend
cause a chirp as described.

I&#39;d look for a slight bump on the facing curve, and rock the facing on glass
to see if it could felt; Keith has suggested that such bumps can also be
seen by examining how light is reflected off the facing curve

Also I&#39;d measure the tip opening at each corner of the tip, using a tip
gauge with pointed probe and/ or check the straightness of the facing at the
very tip with a thick feeler gauge.

Re the advice to make it like a Berg, Lance, are you suggesting a bullet
shaped baffle cut-out?

            <div class='message__subject'>SUBJECT: Re: Metal Link &quot;chirp&quot;</div>

            <pre class='message__body'>Berg Larson mouthpieces are very good but differrent from a whalum sugal model significantly. Their are 4 differrent baffles on the classic Berg. They mark them with the tip opening first and then the baffle shape under that. You can go to ebay and copy the mouthpiece pictures of the various chamber designs. From their you can figure out exactly how high the baffle is on each type and how it is shaped. The bullet shape is the style where the chamber looks to be bored into the baffle and tapers in a bullet shape. The o models look like dukoffs with the baffle straight and no bullet shape to them. The baffle behind the tip also varies with each of the 4 chambers. One is similar to the trane link, while others are closer to a roll over look at the tip and others steeper.
 
Since you have a mouthpiece that you wish to modify I would suggest the following. I would buy an inexpensive close faced mouthpiece or two. First I would duplicate the facing on the Sugal. Next I would use dental wax and duplicate the baffle of the Sugal. You have the mouthpiece so measure and duplicate it. Now on the blank you can remove anywhere on the baffle material and add it back in until you find what you like.
 
I can not speak about science but until health took playing from me I taught and played professionaly for years.I read posts but rarely reply as I prefer to be helpfull. When teaching and when trying mouthpiecs and horns I would pay particular attention to A2. Students tend to play with more pressure in the low register and when they get to a2 start sounding terrible. They have not developed proper breathing as they start on the low register and it is easier to play in tune without adequate support. Why A2 is problematic is the octave vent moves from the body to the neck on that pitch. If the mouthpiece is not properly placed it will play 2 differrent scales on the instrument. With students I would use tunes like My one and only love to develop pitch awareness and proper breathing for intonation. Each vent destroys the fundamental allowing for the second partial to speak. D2 is the beginning of the first vent and A2 is the beginning of the second
 vent. It is not a coincidence that these are the most problematic tuning notes. When trying mouthpieces I learned to play intervals paying particular attention to d and a. I also would play the mouthpiece through the harmonic series listerning for intonation juast playing 1,3,5, octave in all keys. I found that occasionally a mouthpiece that I judged to be poor had a differrent tuning spot than my regular mouthpiece. When young I would play bebop licks and not choose the best mouthpiece. When I play test a mouthpiece I do the same arpeggios after each adjustment. If I have to change embouchure too much for intonation I know it is not right. Another thing that I used with students is something that Joe Allard taught which is playing the upper octave with out the octave key and then playing the lower octave like a flute player. It teaches lip pressure, oral cavity shape, and proper use of air in a way that is often difficult to describe to someone. I
 will say that most good pieces that I have played tend to tune well pushed very far in.
 
I wish you well in adjusting your Sugal. I hope that some of this helps. I am not trying to give a sax lesson I do not know how you play. I will end with one final thought. You said that you worked on the table. This would have shortened the space in the window between the reed and the baffle. If you get too little space you will chirp and/or  have a harder time with low notes. Good luck.

Thanks for the advice! I would like to follow this advice, but I must admit that English is not my language, so I did not understand everything you wrote, especially this: "mill out the slanted baffle drop-off, turning it into a scoop-billed Berg" design." 

Isn&#39;t scoop-billed Berg a high baffle mouthpiece with a sharp edge where the baffle ends? I&#39;ve already rounded the baffle where it enters the chamber. Should I round it more or should I make it sharper? Or is it the chamber that have to be bigger? I did not think that the baffle so far inside the mpc would create a squeak, I thought this was due to the baffle closer to the tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>IME chirping (when the mouthpiece is at fault) is usually the baffle being not just right height and/or not even.  Next is facing, either asymmetrical, or curving too tight somewhere, usually near the tip.

            <pre class='message__body'>What all the others said about chirping is correct, as I know you know, but a volume/frequency mismatch can cause chirping as well, and much worse.  Anything that affects the scale, affects the alignment of resonance peaks, and that alignment is what determines how easily or with what difficultly/how cleanly, notes speak.  It starts to become apparent in the upper register (A2-C#3) as note instability on attack, undefined pitch center, and undefined tonal center, where one is no longer able to match the reed resonance to the fingered fundamental resonance&#39;s upper mode, and maintain correct playing pitch comfortably.  The larger the mismatch, the more all aspects of pitch, tone, stability, and response suffer, until the reed just closes and stays closed.

In your Sugal case, the mismatch is just at the point where the pitch center is undefined and upper register attacks are starting to become unstable.

One must differentiate between volume/frequency considerations and chamber/baffle types which determine the basic tonal/response qualities.  If I&#39;m making a mouthpiece, I first decide what chamber/baffle type I want (short roll-over, long roll-over, flat high baffle, squeeze, square, straight side walls, hollowed side walls, etc.,) for the respective characteristics they offer.  Once I know what sound I want, then I figure out how to match the volume/frequency using the remaining cavity volume distribution and if necessary, by making compromises in chamber/baffle design or volume/frequency.  Some extreme chambers designs can not be balanced.

So now you have lowered the baffle and rounded the drop-off.  If you like that sound, you have to figure out how to make the overall cavity a bit shorter and fatter to fix the problems and not loose the sound you like.  Fun!  In my experience with flat baffle pieces, removing material just after the drop-off is the most tonally neutral.  

Have any picts?

Had he not rounded the baffle drop-off, I would have suggested a straight edged drop-off, similar to the scoop-billed Berg Larsen, to retain as much of the original Sugal design as possible.  A bullet Berg drop-off would work too, but would be another step away from what he started with.

Volume-frequency mismatch notwithstanding, I do not see how this would tend cause a chirp as described.



I&#39;d look for a slight bump on the facing curve, and rock the facing on glass to see if it could felt; Keith has suggested that such bumps can also be seen by examining how light is reflected off the facing curve



Also I&#39;d measure the tip opening at each corner of the tip, using a tip gauge with pointed probe and/ or check the straightness of the facing at the very tip with a thick feeler gauge.



Re the advice to make it like a Berg, Lance, are you suggesting a bullet shaped baffle cut-out?

Thanks for the advice! I would like to follow this advice, but I must admit that English is not my language, so I did not understand everything you wrote, especially this: "mill out the slanted baffle drop-off, turning it into a scoop-billed Berg" design." 



Isn&#39;t scoop-billed Berg a high baffle mouthpiece with a sharp edge where the baffle ends? I&#39;ve already rounded the baffle where it enters the chamber. Should I round it more or should I make it sharper? Or is it the chamber that have to be bigger? I did not think that the baffle so far inside the mpc would create a squeak, I thought this was due to the baffle closer to the tip.

Sometimes a  reed will seem to play well but because it is not flat and there is not a good seal between reed and table , will squeak on certain notes.     Peter</pre>

            <pre class='message__body'>I once had a customer, a long time friend, send me a bari mouthpiece, I think it was an RIA, that would chirp and squeak.  He sent me some of the reeds he was using.

I check the facing, which measured even, and no detectable "kinks" or "bumps" in the facing.  The table was flat.  The mouthpiece looked well made and finished.  I could see nothing wrong.

I tried some of my reeds, and I could not force it to squeak or chirp.  I sent the mouthpiece back to him with a few new reeds of my brand (Fibracell), along with a bill for the reeds, and his mouthpiece unchanged.  He was very happy that a simple reed change solved his problem.

Right on.  

When I send someone with vintage horn (Martin)/modern mouthpiece pitch issues, a mouthpiece matched to their horn, they often chirp and squeak initially.  I tell them that they have to:

1. try various reeds to get the best type for the new mouthpiece - their old reed just might not work

2. re-learn were all the notes are with the new set-up.  The wild adjustments they had been making to manage the old mismatched mouthpiece only cause a matched setup to behave poorly.  It can take a day or two.  Then they are ecstatic.

            <pre class='message__body'>yea and amen. and one should not assume that a mouthpiece that has the same tip opening will take the same reed. facings with a more relaxed curve will take a harder reed than those with a tighter curve or a sharper break. This became clear to me recently when trying a Brilhart HR piece with the same tip opening as my link. I bought some softer reeds and, lo and behold, it plays like a dream. jt

Some say that you should leave them on because they take a set and others say you should never leave them on for the same reason.  I heard the famous British clarinet player Reginald Kell ( the Barney Bigard of classical!) speaking once and he said once he set his reed on the mouthpiece he  never took it off again until the reed died.  I was assuming  that we would be trying mouthpieces with either a new  synthetic or one that had been stored flat.  Peter</pre>

Must be that the stuff that accumulates on the reed&#39;s underside has a
beneficial effect on tone!

You are correct, I don&#39;t.  I tell them to remove the reed after each playing session, carefully wipe it dry, and place it in a reed holder such as the Lavoz Reedguard IV, not in a sealed Rico "Novapack".  Also, to number the reedguard slots 1, 2, 3, 4, and to alternate reeds.  Better, have 2 reedguards, for a total of 8 reeds.  1-4 are the performing reeds, 5-8 are the newer practice reeds being broken in.  As reeds in the 1-4 reedguard go out, they are replaced by ones from the 5-8 reedguard.

But I don&#39;t need so many now that I play Fibracells.  ;-)

            <pre class='message__body'> That&#39;s all excellent advice to give to students about having goods reeds on hand at all times. But of course we must also learn the art of playing on that reed suddenly gone bad or gotten  suddenly damaged.  I grew up in Montreal. In the summer it is humid and the reeds get "waterlogged" and difficult to play. I&#39;m sure people in the South East are familiar with that.  Then in winter the temperature is below freezing and  buildings are heated so the humidity plummets to Saharan levels. Finding a   reed  that plays and continues to play becomes  a crap shoot. We all had our reeds in  neatly numbered Lavoz reed holders and none played for very long despite preparation, curing time etc. A little glass bottle full of water  to soak them in often worked for a while.   I haven&#39;t played there since decent synthetic reeds have come on the market but they must be a blessing. It makes sense that Legere comes from that part of the world. Playing on a
 bad reed is an essential skill needed   to be a reed player. Some players, like Sonny Stitt and Nick Brignola were already  playing on the early synthetic reeds,which were just a slab of plastic in the shape of a reed. They learned to play on a bad reed because they were using them all the time! For me the best thing that ever happened in dealing with reeds was  acquiring Tom Ridenour&#39;s reed fixing kit.  Peter

I have played on a Fibracell the last few days and is very positive surprised how quickly one adapts to a new, brighter reed.

We will play a concert in a couple of weeks, maybe we do a recording then.

            <pre class='message__body'>As I expected.  IME, you have to get rid of all the material after the drop-off for it to have an accurate pitch center.  The half flat baffle/half-roll-over design necessitates pitch compromises.

If you actually record yourself, I think you will find that the Fibracell is not really any brighter than regular cane reeds.  You are hearing "reed slap" against the tip of the mouthpiece, through your teeth, and bones in the head, directly to the ear.  This effect can also be heard the other way, when players put a rubber patch on the beak of the mouthpiece, and think the tone is darker.  It is, but only to the player&#39;s ear.  The player will hear different tones due to material of the mouthpiece, too.  To truly evaluate, record and playback and listen.

            <pre class='message__body'> I envy you guys who  find the synthetics the same as a cane reed. I always have a working Fibracell in my case.  They have been life savers several times and I have played one up to a month at a time without going back to cane. However when I finally do slap on a good cane reed  it is like slipping into  my most comfortable shoes again.
