            <pre class='message__body'>Hi all,

I have a proposal re: The Acoustic Discussion. First, I thank Keith for his patience and for hosting it on this forum. However, I do not believe that this is the appropriate venue for it in its present form.

Discussions like these are works-in-progress, and often meander, hit dead ends, reverse themselves, wander into narrow alleys and generally are all over the place. This is natural and is part of the process. However there is no need to do this on this forum. as it turns out.

The original idea of keeping the discussion public stemmed from the thought that perhaps others might wish to participate. In fact, this has not happened, and it appears that the general feeling is that our posts do not make a positive addition to the group as constituted.

Given the history between certain interested parties, moving the discussion to the acoustics group does not seem like an ideal solution; therefore I propose the following:

The main part of this discussion should be taken private. It is quite easy to form an email group, in which all members of that group receive all posts to and from other group members. Some years ago when I was heavily into writing fractal algorithms for use in algorithmic art programs, we used this method for beta-testing the formulae before release. This spared the main group the endless bug reports, but in the end important results gleaned from the private traffic were posted to the main group.

If we formed an email group among parties interested in the acoustic topics, the bulk of the forum members would be spared all the nuts-and-bolts, back-and-forth traffic. If the group members agreed that something worth sharing was happening, a post to the forum could be made. This might be win-win in several ways. First, it would spare the forum subscribers from having to sit through a lot of stuff that doesn&#39;t interest them in the least. Second, it would remove the members of the discussion from the pressure of being in public, and would stop any grandstanding that might occur, although I don&#39;t really think that has been happening here. Third, it would allow whatever gems are finally mined out of the tons of ore to be presented cleanly, without forum members being forced to sift through tons of silt to find the hidden nugget.

Practically it would mean only that anyone interested in receiving private email messages relating to the dicussion put their names forward. Only one person has to collect all the names and put them (for convenience) into a group in OE. After a single message is sent out, everyone wishing to participate need only hit the "reply to all" button when sending a message. Things are pretty much autonomous after that, although if people wish to join or leave the group someone pretty much needs to take responsibility to maintain the group list and make sure the name is either present or removed from the group traffic for a few posts, until all the residual "reply to all" posts have gotten on track. In a group of less than 20 persons this is no sweat, and I doubt we will have near to that number from the tenor of the posts to the forum lately ;-)

I throw this proposal out for discussion.

Hi all,

 

I have a proposal re: The Acoustic Discussion. First, I thank Keith for his
patience and for hosting it on this forum. However, I do not believe that
this is the appropriate venue for it in its present form.

 

Discussions like these are works-in-progress, and often meander, hit dead
ends, reverse themselves, wander into narrow alleys and generally are all

no need to do this on this forum. as it turns out.

 

The original idea of keeping the discussion public stemmed from the thought

Given the history between certain interested parties, moving the discussion
to the acoustics group does not seem like an ideal solution; therefore I
propose the following:

 

The main part of this discussion should be taken private. It is quite easy
to form an email group, in which all members of that group receive all posts
to and from other group members. Some years ago when I was heavily into
writing fractal algorithms for use in algorithmic art programs, we used this

My earlier statement on the "circular arguments" with Lance would apply to this forum as well.  Thanks for your support.

Some years ago when I was heavily into writing fractal algorithms for use in algorithmic art programs, we used this method for beta-testing the formulae before release. This spared the main group the endless bug reports, but in the end important results gleaned from the private traffic were posted to the main group.

If the group members agreed that something worth sharing was happening, a post to the forum could be made. This might be win-win in several ways. First, it would spare the forum subscribers from having to sit through a lot of stuff that doesn&#39;t interest them in the least. Second, it would remove the members of the discussion from the pressure of being in public, and would stop any grandstanding that might occur, although I don&#39;t really think that has been happening here. Third, it would allow whatever gems are finally mined out of the tons of ore to be presented cleanly, without forum members being forced to sift through tons of silt to find the hidden nugget.

Only one person has to collect all the names and put them (for convenience) into a group in OE. After a single message is sent out, everyone wishing to participate need only hit the "reply to all" button when sending a message. Things are pretty much autonomous after that, although if people wish to join or leave the group someone pretty much needs to take responsibility to maintain the group list and make sure the name is either present or removed from the group traffic for a few posts, until all the residual "reply to all" posts have gotten on track. In a group of less than 20 persons this is no sweat, and I doubt we will have near to that number from the tenor of the posts to the forum lately ;-)
