            <pre class='message__body'>Personally I keep my facing curves extremely accurate (within .0002" 
or so), it&#39;s hard to see how Lebayle can keep a consistent curve 
there at the tip with doing all that hand filing.  I haven&#39;t played 
their pieces but have seen some of the wooden ones at Roberto&#39;s in 
NYC - a bit shallow behind the tip rail, seems like it would be 
awfully bright. The bullet chamber reminds me of a Lawton. -Ken

I was curious about this mouthpiece design, which looked like a Berg with an
elongated bullet. What does it look like close up - who has seen one of
these?

What is the effect of a baffle like this, compared to a shorter bullet,
compared to a step baffle?

Has anyone played a Lebayle mpc?

Even given that player&#39;s mouthpiece is another&#39;s doorstop, I&#39;m interested to
know how they compare to some other mouthpieces you&#39;ve played.

What style of music are you playing with them. How are they for subtoning,
altissimo, dynamic range?

            <pre class='message__body'>I gravitated to the Studio model on the first try and
have remained there, so that&#39;s the one that I know
best.   I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s still making this model,
though... and I get the impression that these &#39;pieces
are kind of one-of-a-kind, that this individual
example of this model may work better than that
example of that model, on Tuesdays only, that kind of
a thing.

That being said, I like this &#39;piece a lot, mostly
because it just plain feels good to play.  It blows
nice and free and while it can be quite bright when I
want it to be, there is plenty of warmth down below as
well and it is smooth and not that nasty grating kind
of "bark" that is so often present in the more hyped
(high baffle small chamber) modern mouthpieces.

I played the same Super 20 and the same couple of
mouthpieces (Guy Hawkins and later a Ponzol II-V-I)
for nearly 25 years, until stolen a couple of years
ago.  Since then I have been trying nearly everything
out there, catching up on what&#39;s come along in that
time while having a very firm idea in my head of what
I&#39;m looking for - so making a very comprehensive yet
focused search - and it&#39;s beginning to pay off in that
I can finally make informed decisions about what to
play in what situation, and I have some points of
reference to use when trying to talk about this stuff
with people.  While there&#39;s always a risk of starting
to sound like a wine connoisseur, it doesn&#39;t hurt to
develop this kind of vocabulary if it helps you find
what you&#39;re looking for! 

So, for example, I can tell you that the workmanship
seems very clean and meticulous, and that this has a
very high, broad, and gentle rollover baffle into a
bullet chamber that looks like that of a Berg. (I
think the rollover has the greater effect on how it
plays, because this doesn&#39;t play all that much like a
Berg).  As far as tone goes, in terms of other &#39;pieces
that I know well, I can place the LeBayle Studio
roughly between the Hawkins and a stock Dukoff SPC.  A
bright top end on demand, similar to the Hawkins, but
more complex meat down below, an even nicer subtone,
etc., and that&#39;s saying a lot.  Not quite as snarly as
the Dukoff but it blows similar, yet with much more
flexibility for tonal shading.  Altimisso is promising
- it jumps right out but it is taking some work for me
to make it consistently useful, i.e. getting that
"feel" so that this input of chops and breath will
give me this precise, centered pitch and tone every
time. I think there&#39;s enough potental there to justify
putting in the time to get the most out of this one.

This piece is also very responsive to ligature changes
and I would advise anyone who tries one to spend some
time with that. 

I think you can tell that I like it but there is one
downside - I have pretty awful pitch problems with it
on one horn and one horn only that have me stumped -
guess these two are allergic to each other somehow -
so, pending a solution, I&#39;ve learned to avoid this
combination in public.  Otherwise, it seems pretty
consistent from horn to horn. 

After many years spent with a workload that was 90%
big tours, I&#39;m freelancing in S. Florida these days. 
That means big bands, electric-but-not-over-the-top
Top40 bands, R&B and Latin horn section stuff, loud
electric jambands, and some small-group jazz, wish
there was more of that!  The LeBayle can cover the
full spread if it has to.  It is fine in the more
intimate situations - it does change personality with
you as you back off the volume - but acoustic jazz is
a different world from the other stuff that I do and I
find a Link to be a little better-optimized for that.

Sorry to be so verbose, but I hope this at least
covers it!

Tom "TC" Mitchell

            <pre class='message__body'>I appreciate you taking the time to give an accurate impression. Your 
comparison of this mpc with the Berg, attributing the differences largely to
the rollover, is worth thinking about.
