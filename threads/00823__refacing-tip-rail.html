I believe that is the best way. What I do is to put a piece of #600 grit (or finer) sandpaper on a glass plate and holding the mpc by the body with the tip facing away from me I pull it across the sandpaper towards me. You don&#39;t want to create an edge in the facing curve at the tip rail, so you should start the stroke at the break (when the curve begins and roll the mpc along the curve quickly until you get to the tip, where you should hold it firm and continue the stroke to the end of the sandpaper. 

Links are a pain because they are plated, and this will expose bare brass which oxidizes, but then if the tip isn&#39;t original it must be that way already. If you take off a lot of metal you might also want to use a fine file to thin the tip rail and cut back the baffle area just behind the tip. You can use the same sandpaper wrapped around a pencil to smooth it afterwards. That should make the piece blow more freely. If you have them use feeler gauges to make sure that the tip and side rails are of equal heights.

Anyway that is how I do it. Perhaps if that is not a good way someone else can jump in here and add something.

  Ciao a tutti,
  I recently got for free a tenor HR Link n.5. It has a curved tip rail (not original). What is the best procedure to make a flat tip rail on this mpc? (have I to sand the tip rail over a glass plate?)

  Thanks in advance,

            <pre class='message__body'>Toby, I wish I had the equipment to make an MPEG of how to file the
baffle.  I learned by watching Leroy at Runyon.  The files they use are
about 3mm wide, flat on one side, and taper to a point.

The mouthpiece is held flat on the work surface, and the file held more
or less parallel to the work surface.  Since the facing and tip rail are
sloping down, the file is not going to cut directly on the tip.  The
file is moved in small circular motions, and moved back and forth,
making a nice, even width of tip rail.  I use a plastic handle on the
file, and use various things to rest the handle on� the thick glass
sheet I do facing on, or other things.  This allows the angle of the
file to be held constant as I file.

Perhaps I should do some drawings and pictures, and post them?

How about I do this from start to finish, doing the whole facing job?
