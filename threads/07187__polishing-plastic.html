>  One possible source for 2000 grit paper, if there&#39;s one in your area, would be an auto supply store such as NAPA, that caters to professional body shops.  They typically handle 3M papers in fine grits, and you can buy them by the sheet, although they won&#39;t have PSA (adhesive-backed)papers.       One thing to always keep in mind when using sandpaper is that the labeled grit number, even on good papers, is an average number, which means a small portion of the grit particles will be more coarse, and some will be finer.  A method used by professional woodworkers is to cut two pieces from the sheet, and rub them together, face to face a few times.  This helps wear down the larger particles a bit, and will give you a finer finish.  It reduces the life of the paper slightly, but that&#39;s a small price to pay.

Once I have finished smoothing scratches with 800, then 1000, then 1200 paper, then finally 2000 paper, I polish BY HAND, NOT BUFFING WHEEL, with a soft cloth and Kit Scratch Out.  This is a plastic polish intended for plexiglass/acrylic windshields, motorcycle faceshields, etc.

Others use Flitz or other fine polishes, and I am sure those probably work as well.

This only takes a few minutes but greatly improves the impression of your work quality to your customer.
