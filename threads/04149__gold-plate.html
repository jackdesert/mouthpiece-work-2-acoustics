I have worked on V16s but I do not recall that there was no silver layer.

  I was involved in a project recently where I was asked to gold plate a mark VI tenor (not my decision to do this). I looked into various methods of plating and received a number of porfessional opinions. The result was that although it is better to plate gold over silver because it does have a better adhesive reaction, it is not essential as gold will quite happily plate straight onto brass. The key to this is of course to make sure the brass is throughly clean, making sure any chemical deposits from cleaning are removed and also to be absolutely sure that the plating tanks are free from any sort of contanimation. Also, once the brass is prepared ready for plating it must be bagged immdeiately to prevent air getting to it and oxidising. I used a company in Watford www.fhlambert.co.uk You can try talking to these guys, ask to speak to Frank Lambert. It is a nightmare getting real accurate advice on this kind of area. I apoligise if I&#39;m going over stuff that you already know

Hello Steve,
 
I was involved in a project recently where I was asked to gold plate a mark
VI tenor (not my decision to do this). I looked into various methods of
plating and received a number of porfessional opinions. The result was that

better adhesive reaction, it is not essential as gold will quite happily
plate straight onto brass. The key to this is of course to make sure the
