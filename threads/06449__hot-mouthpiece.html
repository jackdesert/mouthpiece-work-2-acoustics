if this could be done but was unaware of solder without lead.(my

what is the compound? Does it have a much higher melt heat?
Does it warp the piece very much? Does it plate? What compounds would 
it adhear to?
I guess you would do the baffle first, then straighten everything out.

I would be very interested to hear more.

FYI, some members do not get questions posted until the next day when the "daily digest" comes out.  But most of the active members get it right away.
 
I have read where Adam Niewood has used silver solder inside Links to make baffles.
 
If you are very close to a tip rail, like within 1/8", the leading edge shape can be important.  My added baffles usually start 1/4" to 1/2" away from the tip rail.  
 
A creamy epoxy such as J-B Weld can be used to fill in the leading edge of an epoxy putty baffle.  Before you do this, you can test using dental wax whether it will make a difference or not. 
 
I&#39;m not moved to try any kind of melted metal to make a baffle.  I see more problems than benefits.

            <pre class='message__body'>Within the bore, localized changes, even when relatively large, affect things much less than very small dimensional changes over a larger area. I seriously doubt that a small scratch would be noticeable. Think about those great Guardalas full of file marks at the baffle. 

I try to polish the baffle when I redo one, but I have not noticed significant differences before and after removing all the small file marks and scratches. 

With careful work and polishing the interface between the mpc material and the epoxy is something like 1/1000" or less. This is really minor. 1/1000" difference in the height of the baffle generally might make a minor difference, but not something so local.

            Within the bore, localized changes, even when relatively large, affect things much less than very small dimensional changes over a larger area. I seriously doubt that a small scratch would be noticeable. Think about those great Guardalas full of file marks at the baffle. 



I try to polish the baffle when I redo one, but I have not noticed significant differences before and after removing all the small file marks and scratches. 



With careful work and polishing the interface between the mpc material and the epoxy is something like 1/1000" or less. This is really minor. 1/1000" difference in the height of the baffle generally might make a minor difference, but not something so local.

                  I see your point as far as flat baffles are concerned.  I&#39;m adding just a very little material to a roll-over baffle however.  It starts right at the tip rail and extends back about 3/8".  I sleep better knowing that the 2 metals are fused, and that there isn&#39;t even a 1/1000" bump just behind my tip rail.

                    Within the bore, localized changes, even when relatively large, affect things much less than very small dimensional changes over a larger area. I seriously doubt that a small scratch would be noticeable. Think about those great Guardalas full of file marks at the baffle. 

                    I try to polish the baffle when I redo one, but I have not noticed significant differences before and after removing all the small file marks and scratches. 

                    With careful work and polishing the interface between the mpc material and the epoxy is something like 1/1000" or less. This is really minor. 1/1000" difference in the height of the baffle generally might make a minor difference, but not something so local.

                            Hmmm..... help me out here then.  Everything I&#39;ve read and experienced indicates that the shape and smoothness of the surface so close to the tip rail has a huge effect on how the mouthpiece responds.  Even the smallest scratch will be noticable.  Are you saying that this is not the case when one uses epoxy?

                              The little edge doesn&#39;t affect anything, and epoxy is so much easier to work with...
