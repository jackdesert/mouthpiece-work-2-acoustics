            <pre class='message__body'>After years of curiosity, I finally acquired a wooden tenor mouthpiece from eBay. It has no markings, so I'm skeptical about the details provided by the seller, but the price was right and although the tip is too small for me, it plays quite well.
 

 Here is the seller's description:
 "This is a interesting turn of the century wood mouthpiece for tenor saxophone. The mouthpiece is most likely a French blank of some sort from the late 1800's or very early 1900's, possibly Buffet. It has an extremely open chamber on its inside as well as a very small tip opening at .055”."
 

 Can anyone confirm these details? Also I would love to know the type of wood. I've read that African Blackwood, and Rosewood were common, and if it helps, this wood does not float which I know is a characteristic of the Blackwood but only some types of Rosewood.
 

 Finally, I have heard many stories about instability, warping and cracking with wood pieces. Is there a consensus about the cause of these problems? Is it just moisture on the inside and absorbing into the wood during playing, or is it possibly changes in storage temperature and humidity that cause these problems as well?
 

 I'm keeping this piece in sealed tupperware with a 55% humidipak. I read that is a good humidity for keeping clarinets stable and I hope it will work for mouthpieces as well.
 

 I am doing some stability measurements/testing now, but after that I plan to oil it with almond oil. I have read that doing this every 6 to 12 months will help prevent it from taking in moisture and cracking.
 

 Any other info, experiences and opinions would be greatly appreciated.
 

 I can't wait to get this piece opened up to .100 or so. :)
 

 Thanks again!

Probably grenadilla. I have a number of original tarogato mpcs which are 
also of wood. I suggest putting a mpc patch on it, as you would be 
surprised how quickly the top teeth will wear away the wood.

I am a woodworker, and I use a lot of cocobolo (rosewood).  It has a very allergic effect on many people.
I know a guy that made some harmonica combs from rosewood, and his lips swoll up.

After years of curiosity, I finally acquired a wooden tenor mouthpiece from eBay. It has no markings, so I&#39;m skeptical about the details provided by the seller, but the price was right and although the tip is too small for me, it plays quite well.

Here is the seller&#39;s description:
"This is a interesting turn of the century wood mouthpiece for tenor saxophone. The mouthpiece is most likely a French blank of some sort from the late 1800&#39;s or very early 1900&#39;s, possibly Buffet. It has an extremely open chamber on its inside as well as a very small tip opening at .055”."

Can anyone confirm these details? Also I would love to know the type of wood. I&#39;ve read that African Blackwood, and Rosewood were common, and if it helps, this wood does not float which I know is a characteristic of the Blackwood but only some types of Rosewood.

Finally, I have heard many stories about instability, warping and cracking with wood pieces. Is there a consensus about the cause of these problems? Is it just moisture on the inside and absorbing into the wood during playing, or is it possibly changes in storage temperature and humidity that cause these problems as well?

Any other info, experiences and opinions would be greatly appreciated.

I can&#39;t wait to get this piece opened up to .100 or so. :)

Probably not Rosewood.

I am a woodworker, and I use a lot of cocobolo (rosewood).  It has a very allergic effect on many people.

I know a guy that made some harmonica combs from rosewood, and his lips swoll up.

            <pre class='message__body'>I wouldn&#39;t consider myself an expert but I agree, it looks like it could be
grenadilla (african blackwood), particularly based on the grain pattern.
I&#39;ve also heard rosewood reported as a sensitizer but I think severe
reactions are probably pretty uncommon.  I had a rosewood mouthpiece made
by Francois Louis in the 1980&#39;s in my possession for some time and no
allergy.

There are several varieties of "rosewood."  I have seen cocobolo used as a
substitute but haven&#39;t heard it classified as rosewood before even though
the genus is the same.  Cocobolo is notoriously allergenic.
