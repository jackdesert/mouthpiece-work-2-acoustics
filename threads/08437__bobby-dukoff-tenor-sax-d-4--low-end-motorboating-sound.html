After flattening the table, did you compensate for how much you shortened
the facing? Blend the back of the facing curve into the table gently and see
if that helps.

It is also important that the low C key opening at the front of the key is at least 1/3 the diameter of the low C tonehole for the low D to vent properly.

Thank you for all of the help and suggestions.  I need to get a glass gauge so that I can compare the curve of my Dukoff 7 to the 4.  I don&#39;t want to mess it up.  I will give your tips a try as soon as I get the gauge.

On my tenor and soprano, set up by Les Arbuckle, the pad height is about 1/4
of the tone-hole diameter.

I concur with others, that having flattened his table a bit, his facing
curve no longer transitions smoothly at the break, causing this problem.

That seems pretty high, with a long key throw even at that height. 

On my tenor and soprano, set up by Les Arbuckle, the pad height is about 1/4
of the tone-hole diameter.

curve no longer transitions smoothly at the break, causing this problem.
